    description: |-
      This engine template provides personalized recommendation for e-commerce applications with the following features by default:
      * Exclude out-of-stock items
      * Provide recommendation to new users who sign up after the model is trained
      * Recommend unseen items only (configurable)

    name: Similar Product
    repo: "https://github.com/PredictionIO/template-scala-parallel-similarproduct"
    description: |-
       This engine template recommends products that are "similar" to the input product(s). Similarity is not defined by user or item attributes but by users' previous actions. By default, it uses 'view' action such that product A and B are considered similar if most users who view A also view B. The template can be customized to support other action types such as buy, rate, like..etc
